# JS30 Day 1

Building a drum kit using Javascript. We are using `data-*` attribute for creating custom attributes inside HTML tags. We also used `KeyboardEvent` to listen for which key we pressed on the keyboard. Lastly, we play the sound associated with the key using `audio` tag. 

List of Javascript functions learned:
1. `document.querySelector` & `document.querySelectorAll`
    
    These functions are used to get HTML elements (or tags).
    These functions will receive a selector which defines what kind of tag you are looking for. The `document.querySelector` function will return the first element that matches the selector, otherwise it will return `null`. The `document.querySelectorAll` function will return all the element matches the selector, otherwise it will return empty `NodeList` (Array-like).

    `document.querySelector(selector)`
    `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`
    | Parameter | Data Type | Explanation |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `selector` | string | string that contains valid CSS syntax |

    Example:
    ```Javascript
    document.querySelector('h1')
    // it will return the first h1 tag it found
    document.querySelector('button[data-key="65"]')
    // it will return the first button with the data-key attribute with value of 65
    document.querySelectorAll('div:nth-child(even)')
    // it will return all the div elements that shows up in the even position relative to its parent
    ```

2. `data-*` attribute
   
   `data-*` attribute is an attribute that allows us to use custom attribute using the standard HTML elements. The custom attribute can be any string and should not contain any semicolon and uppercase letter

   by using `data-*` attribute, it would be easier for us to group and look for the custom attribute related to the elements

   `data-*` attributes is used to create a standard HTML elements for a custom attribute, so if we omit the `data-*` we can still use custom attribute, but not by the HTML standard

   to use `data-*` attribute, we just need to combine the `data-*` syntax with our custom attribute

   Example:
   ```HTML
   <div data-key="52" data-sizing="px">
     <!--our custom attributes above is key and sizing, so to use data attribute we just need to add data- in front of it-->
   ```

3. `propertyName` & `TransitionEvent`
   
   `propertyName` property returns the name of the CSS property associated with the transition, when a transition event occurs. `TransitionEvent` create a transition event with the given parameters

   `propertyName` syntax : event.propertyName

   | Types | Function |
   | --- | --- |
   | `transitioncancel` | triggered an event when a CSS transition has been cancelled |
   | `transitionend` | triggered an event when a CSS transition has finished playing |
   | `transitionrun` | triggered an event when a CSS transition is created (at the start of any transition delay) |
   | `transitionstart` | triggered an event when a CSS transition has begun (at the end of any transition delay, when the actual animation started) |

   Example:
   ```Javascript
   document.querySelector('div').addEventListener('transitionend', tell)
   // it will find the first div element and when the transitionend event occurs, it will fired tell function
   function tell(event) {
     console.log(event.propertyName)
   }
   // showing the propertyName of the event on the console tab
  ```


4. `Element.classList`
   
   The `classList` property returns the class name(s) of an element, useful to add, remove, and toggle CSS classes on an element. It returns a DOMTokenList, an array-like object representing the contents of the element's class attribute.

   Example:
   ```Javascript
   div.classList.toggle('turningRed', i < 10)
   // When the value of i is less than 10, will add CSS class of 'turningRed' on the div element, and when the value of i is more than 10, will remove the class of 'turningRed' on the div element
   div.classList.add('turningRed')
   // Add the CSS class of turningRed to div element
   div.classList.remove('turningRed')
   // Remove the CSS class of turningRed on the div element
   ```

5. `currentTime` & `play()`
   
   `currentTime` is an HTMLMediaElement property specifies the current playback time in seconds. For media without a known duration, such as media being streamed live, it's possible the browser may not be able to obtain the current playback time. `play()` is an HTMLMediaElement method used to begin playback of a media. It returns a `promise` which is resolved when playback has been successfully started

   Example:
   ```Javascript
   if (audio.currentTime = 0) {
     audio.play()
   }
   // when the current playback time of the audio is 0, the media will play automatically
  ```

7. `Array.from()`
   
   `Array.from` creates a new, `shallow-copied` array instance from an array-like or iterable object. It returns a new array instance. `shallow-copy` means we only copy the elements of the array, but does not copy the exact objects, so if change any elements in the new array, it will changes the original array too.

   Syntax: `Array.from(arrayLike [,mapFn [, thisArg]])`

   The parameter mapFn is optional, which allows us to execute a map() function on each element of the array being created

   Example: 
   ```Javascript
   Array.from([1, 2, 3], x = x + 2)
   // create new array of [3, 4, 5]
   ```

8. `KeyboardEvent`
   
   `KeyboardEvent` objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard. There are 3 KeyboardEvent type that usually delivered to `element`, `document`, and `window`. `keyCode`

   | Type | Explanation |
   | --- | --- |
   | keydown | a key has been pressed |
   | keyup | a key has been released |
   | keypress | a key with character value is pressed, such as Alt, Shift, Ctrl will not be counted |

   Example:
   ```Javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', alert)
   // adds an event listener function that will run the function 'alert' when the keydown event is happened
   function alert() {
     alert('The keyboard was pressed')
   }
   // function to show alert message
   ```

9.  `addEventListener` & `removeEventListener`
    
    `addEventListener` is an `EventTarget` method that sets up a function whenever the specified event is happened on the target. Most common event targets are Element, Document, and Window. You can also remove the listeners using `removeEventListener`

    syntax: `target.addEventListener(type, Listener)`

    the parameter `type` is a case-sensitive string representing the event type to listen for.
    the parameter `Listener` is an object that will be triggered when an event of the specified `type` occurs

    Example: 
    ```Javascript
    document.querySelectorAll('button').addEventListener('click', alert)
    // it will find all the 'button' elements and triggered the alert function whenever the click event is happened towards the button element
    function alert() {
      alert('Oh my, it is pressed')
    }
    // function to show alert message
    ```
